                        The Shri Madhusudan Bhagwan Temple in Kashi is a kashi khandokat temple, dedicated to Lord Vishnu, and is believed to be self-manifested (Swayambhu). There is no documented origin of this temple, and the present priests are descendants of the Shakaladweepi Brahmins who have traditionally served and worshipped here.

In later times, Maharaja Dadu, the former king of Ayodhya, established a Narmadeshwar Mahadev of crystal in his estate, in front of the same Madhusudan Bhagwan. He also renovated the Madhusudan Bhagwan Temple and appointed Dhanesh Mishra, who was already a priest of Madhusudan Bhagwan, as the priest of Narmadeshwar Mahadev.

Madhusudan Bhagwan is also known as Vaman Keshav, and it is believed that visiting Madhusudan Bhagwan (Vaman Keshav) during the month of Vaishakh brings immense spiritual merit, fulfillment of desires, and accomplishments. The deity prefers offerings of butter and sugar, and garlands of fragrant Vaijayanti flowers. During the Adhik Maas (extra month in the Hindu calendar), the deity is also offered Malpua. The special significance of this deity is mentioned in the Vaishakh Mahatmya (authored by Vedavyasa). Traditional rituals involve worshipping trees in the temple and listening to Kathas (stories) during the month of Vaishakh. Lamps with five wicks are lit between Ekadashi and Purnima, and on Chaturdashi, the deity is bathed with Panchamrit.

The temple of Madhusudan Bhagwan in Kashi is situated in the Kameshwar Mahadev locality, above the Trilochan Ghat, in Ayodhya Kothi. Every year, during the month of Vaishakh, a large number of devotees visit this temple, mesmerized by its spiritual aura and grace.

            <h3>Story Associated with Name</h3>
            <p>
                Madhusudan is an important name of Lord Krishna. He got this name because he killed Madhu, an ancient demon enemy. A demon named Madhu had started troubling the Devs. He had received a boon from Brahma Dev that only a bhagawan could kill him. Madhu, with his power, drove the devs out of heaven and took over the heaven. The devs sought a solution to this problem from Brahma Dev. Brahma Dev told them that to kill Madhu, they would have to take the incarnation of Lord Vishnu. That is why, Lord Vishnu took the Vamana avatar to kill Madhu. When the Vamana avatar killed Madhu, Lord Vishnu came to be known as Madhusudan. Later, when Lord Vishnu incarnated as Lord Krishna, this name got attached to him. Thats why Vaman Keshav Known as Madhushudan.
